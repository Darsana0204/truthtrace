# TruthTrace

## AI-Powered Digital Asset Protection System

TruthTrace is an AI-powered platform that detects duplicate and near-duplicate media, verifies originality using digital fingerprinting, predicts copyright misuse risk, and generates ownership certificates to protect digital content from unauthorized reuse.

---

## Problem Statement

Sports organizations and media companies create valuable digital assets such as match photos, exclusive videos, promotional content, and event coverage. Once uploaded online, this content is often copied, reposted, edited, and redistributed without permission.

This leads to:

* Copyright infringement
* Unauthorized content reuse
* Fake ownership claims
* Brand reputation damage
* Revenue loss from piracy

Most existing systems detect issues only after the damage is done.

---

## Our Solution

TruthTrace helps organizations proactively protect digital assets by:

* Detecting exact duplicate uploads
* Identifying near-duplicate modified content
* Generating a TruthScore for originality
* Predicting copyright misuse risk
* Creating ownership certificates as proof of originality
* Providing Gemini AI-powered explanations and admin recommendations
